# Visualizing Olin's Email Data
A creative coding project using p5.js and Matter.js. Based on data collected by [@seanfoley123](http://github.com/seanfoley123).

## Mechanics
Dragging the slider moves you through the history of Olin's mailing lists. Each circle represents a different mailing list, and its size represents the volume of emails sent during the month. New circles fly in whenever a mailing list is created. When a circle turns "clear," this means the mailing list has been inactive (no emails sent) during the entire month.
